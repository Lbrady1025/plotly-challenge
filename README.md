# Plotly Challenge
CWRU Week 15 Homework

The purpose of this assignment was to visualize data from a JSON file containing belly button bateria data using D3 and Plotly. The data was read from the JSON file using D3, and filtered down to select the subject of interest. The data was then visualized using Plotly in a bar chart of the top ten bateria found in the sample, and a bubble chart showing the prevalence of the different types of bacteria. A demographic breakdown of each subject is contained in a panel on the left hand side of the screen.

The options for the subjects are contained in a dropdown menu. Selecting each subject is tied into a function in the HTML that changes the information when selected. The demographics, bar chart, and bubble chart, are dynamically updated.
